/** The Graph Guide — a short lesson, not a legend.
 *
 *  L1/L2/L3 are the single least self-explanatory thing in the product: three
 *  buttons labelled with a letter and a number, controlling a distinction
 *  nobody has met before. A legend listing what the colours mean would not
 *  fix that, because the question a first-time reader has is not "what is
 *  this colour" — it is "what am I looking at, and what is underneath it".
 *
 *  So this teaches the one idea that makes the rest obvious: the three levels
 *  are one world at three depths. Then it gets out of the way and stays out,
 *  reopenable from the top bar.
 *
 *  **Every line here describes what is actually rendered.** The encodings are
 *  read off `viewspec.py` and `GraphCanvas.tsx`, not off a design document —
 *  a guide that describes an intended visual language rather than the one on
 *  screen is worse than no guide, because it is believed.
