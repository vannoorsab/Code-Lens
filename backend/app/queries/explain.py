"""Explain — "what is this file, and why does the project need it?"

The other query plans each answer one question. This one assembles the
answer a person actually asks when they click something on the map:

    identity     what it is, where it lives, how big
    role         is it a hub, a leaf, an entrypoint, a risk
    depends_on   what it needs to work        (forward closure)
    used_by      what breaks without it       (reverse closure = blast radius)
    contains     what lives inside it
    evidence     a real dependency path, clickable to file:line

Every field is a deterministic graph fact — this works with no API key and
spends no tokens. CP-3.4's narration sits *on top* of this payload, turning
the same facts into prose; it never replaces them (ARCHITECTURE.md: the
graph answers, the AI explains).

Folders answer too: a module aggregates its files, and its dependencies are
the ones that cross its own boundary — internal wiring is implementation,
what crosses the edge is architecture.
