"""How a blast radius is ordered — the one place the ranking is decided.

## What this replaces, and why

The first ranking was `1/distance + fan_in/1000`. Read it as a formula and it
looks like two signals; read it as numbers and it is one. Distance-1 scores
1.0 and distance-2 scores 0.5, so fan-in could only change the order between
two bands if it differed by 500 — which never happens, because a file with
500 direct dependents does not exist in any of the repositories measured. So
fan-in was a tiebreak inside a distance band and nothing more, and the
ranking was **distance, alphabetically broken**.

That is not a bad first ranking. Distance is genuinely the strongest single
signal. But it is a very coarse one: on a real repo a blast radius has
dozens of files at distance 2, and the graph was ordering them by node id.

## The four signals, and why these four

Every one of them was already computed and stored before this module existed.
Nothing here is a new measurement, and nothing here is a guess dressed as a
measurement:

* **distance** — hops from the change. The product's core claim.
* **co-change** — the Jaccard strength on the `CO_CHANGES` edge
  (`graph/co_change.py`). Files that historically ship together.
* **churn** — `node.churn_count`, commits touching the file
  (`ingestion/git_history.py`). A file that never changes is unlikely to be
  in the next commit whatever the graph says.
* **structure** — fan-in over CALLS + IMPORTS. A hub breaks more widely.

## Normalisation, which is the actual fix

Each signal is mapped into `[0, 1]` *before* it is weighted, so a weight
means what it says. Two of them need shaping first:

`churn` and `fan_in` are heavy-tailed — one file with 400 commits among
thirty with fewer than ten. Min-maxed raw, that file scores 1.0 and every
other file scores approximately 0, which is a switch rather than a signal.
Both are therefore `log1p`-compressed before min-max, so the difference
between 2 and 20 commits survives alongside the difference between 20 and
400.

Min-max is computed **per query, over the candidates of that query**. The
alternative — normalising against the whole repository — makes a small
module's ranking depend on whether some unrelated file elsewhere is busy.
The question is "which of *these* files matters most", so these files are
the population.

## Where the numbers come from

`History` is a protocol with two implementations, and the split is not
incidental — it is what keeps the benchmark honest. The product reads
co-change and churn off the graph, which is correct: when a user asks, all
history is in the past. The benchmark cannot do that, because the graph's
history *includes the commit being graded* — a co-change edge would be
"predicting" a pair it had already watched change together. `WindowedHistory`
recomputes both signals from strictly older commits, which is the same
correction the popularity baseline needed in `ledger/backtest.py`.

#: How these numbers were arrived at, so nobody has to guess later.
#:
#: Grid-searched by `scripts/rank_sweep.py` on four repositories (requests,
#: flask, click, itsdangerous) and reported on four the search never saw
#: (fastapi, express, jinja, markupsafe). Fitting and reporting on the same
#: set would have produced a better number and a worse ranking.
#:
#: **These are not the argmax, deliberately.** The search surface is a
#: plateau: everything from roughly (0.5, 1.0, 1.0) to (2.5, 2.5, 2.5) scores
#: between 0.260 and 0.2625 on the fit set — a 1% spread — and the argmax
#: moved to whatever the grid's edge happened to be, twice, as the grid was
#: widened. A maximum that relocates when you enlarge the search is not a
#: maximum; it is where the search stopped. What the sweep does establish is
#: that having all four signals *on* is worth about 19% over distance alone,
#: while their exact ratio is worth about 1%.
#:
#: So these are the simplest point on the plateau — each normalised signal
#: counts once — chosen on the fit set, where it costs 0.6% against the
#: argmax. See LEDGER.md entry #3.
