"""CodeLens Knowledge Graph schema — the frozen contract.

This is the universal, language-agnostic schema every parser emits into and
every query reads from (FOUNDATION.md §Q1, ARCHITECTURE.md §3).

Rules enforced here:
- Facts and annotations never mix: parser-emitted fields are deterministic;
  AI-derived fields live in `SemanticAnnotation` and always carry
  `derived_from` evidence pointers.
- Every node keys to a content hash for incremental re-analysis.
- CALLS edges carry a confidence level — the graph is honest about its
  own certainty.
