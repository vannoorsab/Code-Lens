"""Git-lite — the temporal layer's first slice (FOUNDATION.md §Q3).

One `git log --numstat` pass yields, per file: how often it changes (churn),
how many people touch it (author count), and when it last moved. These are
deterministic facts from history — Layer C's down payment, feeding the risk
formula (complexity × fan-in × churn) and the map's activity glow.

The same pass also yields something the per-file rollup throws away: *which
files changed together in one commit*. That is the raw material for co-change
coupling (`app/graph/co_change.py`), so the log is parsed once into commits
and both facts are derived from that — reading history twice for two views of
the same bytes would be silly.

History is bounded, not complete: clones fetch `HISTORY_DEPTH` commits
(clone.py), so churn counts are "within the last N commits", and a repo older
than that reports the recent past rather than all time. That is the right
trade — recent history is what predicts today's behaviour — but it is a
ceiling, and the numbers should be read as one.

The blobless-clone constraint lives here: history is read with `--name-only`
and must stay that way. See `_run_git_log`.
