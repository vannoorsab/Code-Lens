#: `--numstat` does not, and running it here hangs for minutes lazily
#: refetching every blob in the repository. See git_history.py.

    ## Why the size check cannot live downstream

    `MAX_REPO_SIZE_MB` used to be enforced only in `snapshot_directory`, after
    this function returned — which meant a 50 GB repository was fully
    downloaded to disk and *then* refused. The limit protected the parser and
    advertised itself as protecting the disk, and the disk is what fills. The
    only thing actually bounding a clone was the timeout, so the real ceiling
    was "whatever fits in 300 seconds of bandwidth", which on a fast host is
    tens of gigabytes.

    So the size is watched as the clone runs and git is killed the moment the
    tree crosses the line. Overshoot is bounded by one poll interval rather
    than by the size of the repository, and the partial tree is removed.
