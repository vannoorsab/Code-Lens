"""External dependencies — turning silence into a named fact.

Every import that does not resolve to a file in the repository is currently
nothing: no node, no edge, no trace. That is the single largest source of the
graph's silence, and it is silence about the most ordinary thing in a
codebase — `import requests`, `from django.db import models`, `import React`.

This reads the manifests a project already maintains (`package.json`,
`requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`) and emits an `EXTERNAL_DEPENDENCY` node
per declared package, then a `DEPENDS_ON` edge from every file that imports
one. Three things follow that the graph could not answer before:

    which of our files use this package
    what would a version bump touch
    which dependencies is nothing actually importing

**Declared packages only.** A bare specifier that appears in no manifest gets
no node. It is far more likely to be a stdlib module, a typo, or a
first-party import the resolver failed on than a real undeclared dependency,
and inventing a dependency the project never declared would be exactly the
confident-wrong-answer failure this codebase keeps refusing.

The import-name-to-package-name gap is real and handled where it is knowable:
`import yaml` comes from `PyYAML`, `import sklearn` from `scikit-learn`. Those
mappings are a small, well-known table rather than a guess — and where no
mapping exists, a normalised name match is required, not approximated.
