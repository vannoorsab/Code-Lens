"""Backtesting blast radius against history that already happened.

## The labelled data nobody had to collect

A commit that changes several files is a developer answering our question for
us. They changed `auth.py`, and they *also had to change* `session.py` and
`tests/test_auth.py`. Ask the graph "what breaks if I change auth.py?", rank
the answer, and check how far down the list the other two appear. No survey,
no instrumentation, no users — every repository on GitHub is already full of
graded examples.

## Why precision@K and not precision

Blast radius returns a transitive closure, which on a real repo is hundreds
of files. Scored as a set, precision is near zero and the number is
meaningless — but so is the criticism, because nobody reads a set. They read
the top of a ranked list. So the measure is precision@K and recall@K: of the
first K files the ranking names, how many did the developer actually touch.

## Why a baseline is not optional

"Precision@10 of 0.31" means nothing on its own. Some files change in almost
every commit, so a strategy of "always guess the busiest files" scores
surprisingly well and involves no graph at all. The report therefore always
runs that baseline on exactly the same examples. The graph earns its keep
only by the gap, and if there is no gap, the honest thing is to publish that.

## The leakage this design removes

Two signals the ranking uses — co-change and churn — are derived from git
history, which is the same history this benchmark grades against. Read off
the finished graph they include the commit under test, so "these two files
change together" would be trivially true of the very example being scored.
`collect_examples` therefore builds a `WindowedHistory` per commit, over
strictly older commits only. It is the same correction `popularity_baseline`
needed, for the same reason, and without it the ranking's numbers would look
excellent and reproduce in production not at all.

## The leakage this design accepts, and why it is bounded

Predictions use the graph built from the working tree at HEAD, while the
examples come from earlier commits. A file's dependencies today are not
exactly what they were then. Rebuilding the graph per commit removes this
entirely and costs a checkout plus a full parse per example — hours instead
of minutes — so `backtest()` takes the graph it is given and the caller
decides. The default script samples only recent history, where HEAD is the
closest approximation available, and says so in its output.

The direction of the bias is worth stating plainly: it flatters the graph.
A dependency added *after* the example commit can only help the prediction.
So the honest reading of a HEAD-graph result is **an upper bound**, and it
is reported as one.
