"""The Visualization Engine's core: KnowledgeGraph -> ViewSpec (CP-4.1).

ARCHITECTURE.md §6: the frontend renders ViewSpecs; it never computes truth.
Everything a pixel shows is decided here, server-side, deterministically:

* **Semantic zoom** — zooming changes *what exists*, not magnification
  (EXPERIENCE.md §"city model"). L1 shows districts (top-level modules) with
  aggregated flows; L2 resolves to files; L3 adds classes and functions.
* **Layout** — precomputed. Clusters sit on a ring (the city's districts);
  members fill each district on a golden-angle spiral, hubs at the center.
  Pure trigonometry: deterministic, dependency-free, O(n).
* **Colors** — the risk ramp (cool blue -> hot red) is FOUNDATION's risk
  formula per file; entrypoints get the accent. Honest theater: a warm node
  IS a risky node, never decoration.
* **Choreography** — `assembly_index` replays real construction order:
  entrypoint files first, then BFS outward through IMPORTS, exactly as
  EXPERIENCE.md specifies the hero moment.

    A file's layer is the **longest** chain of imports that arrives at it. Not

    Shortest distance puts a shared helper directly under whoever imports it
    first, so `types.py`, imported by a top-level module *and* by everything
    else, lands at the top of the stack next to the code that starts the
    program. The longest chain says the true thing instead: a file sits below
    everything that leans on it, however far the longest path to it runs, so
    every import on screen points downward and the leaves settle at the floor.

    Layer 0 is the surface: entrypoint files, and files nothing in the
    repository imports. Both are "nothing rests on this" — one because
    execution starts there, the other because it is the top of a dependency
    chain. A library has no `__main__` anywhere and would otherwise have no
    surface at all; this is why jinja rendered as two flat bands before.

    Entrypoints are pinned to the surface even when something does import them
    — a test importing `main.py` does not make `main.py` a detail of the test.

    Import cycles have no layering; that is what a cycle *is*. Their members
