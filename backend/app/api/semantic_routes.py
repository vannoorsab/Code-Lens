"""Semantic endpoints — Stage 3 over HTTP. Thin, like everything in api/.

Two classes of answer, and the split is visible in the status codes:

* Deterministic (no key needed, never 503): concept search, learning path.
* LLM-narrated (503 without ANTHROPIC_API_KEY): project story, blast-radius
  story, summarisation. The graph's facts are never behind the key — only
  the prose about them is.

The summarize endpoint needs the working tree (context snippets are real
source lines), so it re-acquires the source from the snapshot's URL. For
an unchanged repo the content-hash cache makes the LLM cost of a re-run
zero — re-cloning is the only price.
