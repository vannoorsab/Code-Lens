"""The checkpointed pipeline — ARCHITECTURE.md's "pipeline with checkpoints".

Sequential, resumable stages, each reporting completion:

    cloned -> parsed -> metrics -> graph_built           (CP-1.4 + CP-1.5)
    ... -> embeddings -> summaries -> ready              (Stage 3)

Two properties are load-bearing:

* **Idempotent and hash-keyed.** The commit sha is the key. If the store
  already holds a graph for (repo_url, commit_sha), the run skips straight to
  done — re-analysis costs nothing when nothing changed (Constitution 4).
* **Observable.** Every stage completion calls the progress callback. This is
  the single source EXPERIENCE.md's "Understanding…" UI reads from — the
  progress theater and the engineering telemetry are the same events, so the
  UI cannot lie about progress (honest theater).
