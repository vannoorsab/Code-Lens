"""In-process analyze job registry.

A large monorepo can legitimately take a minute or more to clone and parse.
Holding that as one synchronous HTTP request is fragile in a way no timeout
tweak fixes for good: Next.js's rewrite proxy aborts at 30s by default, a
browser's own connection handling can give up, and even a busy Python
process can starve health checks — each severs the SAME long-lived request
differently, so the failure looks different every time while the root cause
never changes. The fix is structural: `/api/analyze` returns in milliseconds,
always, and the browser polls a trivial status endpoint instead.

This is deliberately a small in-memory table, not a real queue. CP-6.2 is
where a durable, multi-worker job system (Celery/arq, Postgres-backed)
belongs — introducing it before there is a second worker process would be
exactly the premature weight CP-0.1 removed. A process restart drops
in-flight jobs; that is an accepted MVP trade-off, stated here rather than
hidden.
