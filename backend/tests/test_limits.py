"""The ceilings that make this API safe to point at the internet.

A limit nobody exercises is a limit that quietly stops working — and the way
it stops working is that everything looks fine right up until a stranger's
loop fills the disk. Each of these pins one failure the limits exist to
prevent, and the HTTP tests check the *contract* a client sees, not just that
a request was refused: a 429 with no `Retry-After` is a dead end.
